## Questions to ask (already researched):
- CSS resets: What is the recommended way to go about CSS resets?
	- Read about using the universal selector `*`  at the top of each stylesheet
	- Read that the `*` selector actually misses some elements and it is better to list elements out for the reset.
	- Read about 'newer' methods of using a separate reset stylesheet that your projects point to/utilize - with the advantage that you can tweak this and it will apply to all past projects without having to go through each one to update. 
- Is there a generally accepted standard CSS reset I should be using?
	- Eric Meyer's? (but is also from like 10 years ago)

## Questions to research:
- .gitignore recommended way? generally global for all repos?
