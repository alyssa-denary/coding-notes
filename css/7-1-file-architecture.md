## Partials
- Intended for multipage larger project (a bit overkill for a single page)
- partials/files typically start with underscore _
- base folder	
	- - `_base`
		- universal reset
			- margin
			- padding
			- box-sizing inherit
		- html
			- font-size: here and not in typography cause determines page proportions
		- body
			- box-sizing
			- everything typography related should go in typography file
	- `_utilities`
	- `_typography`
		- body
			- all typography related properties
		- Natours project example: `_heading-primary` (could argue is component, but just gauge based on what seems most intuitive)
	- `_animations`
		- keyframes
- abstracts folder
	- only going to put code in this folder that is <u>not</u> going to output any CSS
	- `_variables`
		- color variable declarations
	- `_mixins`
	- `_functions`
- components folder
	- reusable building blocks that make up website/apps
	- should be completely independent, can be used anywhere in the page
	- held together by the layout of the page
	- `_button`
- layout folder
	- holds all of the components together
	- for each piece of the global layout of the entire project
	- should work everywhere and on all pages - for specific styles for specific page - use pages folder
	- `_header`
	- `_footer`
	- etc.
- pages folder
	- specific styles for specific pages live in this folder
	- `_home`
- themes folder
	- for cases with a web app with different themes
- vendors folder
	- for 3rd party css, like:
		- CSS file for a bootstrap
		- Icon system
		- Animation framework

### Importing
- Need to import all partials into main file
- Goal is for main file to have no code besides importing the partials
