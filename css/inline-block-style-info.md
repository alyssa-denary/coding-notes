Center the `form` element, by giving it a `margin` of `0 auto`. Then, fix its size to a maximum width of `500px`, and a minimum width of `300px`. In between that range, allow it to have a `width` of `60vw`.

```css
form {

margin: 0 auto;

max-width: 500px;

min-width: 300px;

width: 60vw;

}
```
- To center use auto margins left and right
- center text can use text-align: center
