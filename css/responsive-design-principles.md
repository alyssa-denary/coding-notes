## 1. Fluid Layouts
- Purpose is to allow the webpage to adapt to current viewport width or height
- Can easily accomplish this by using %, vw, or vh units instead of pixel unit 
	- for all units that should adapt to the viewport (usually layout elements)
- Use max-width instead of width
### Layout Types
- Float layouts: Old way, mostly outdated
- Flexbox: One of the modern ways, perfect for one dimensional layouts
- CSS grid: For laying out elements in 
## 2. Responsive Units
- Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
	- makes it easy to scale entire website up or down as needed
## 3. Flexible images
- Images donâ€™t by default scale as the viewport is changed
- Always use % for image dimensions
	- along with max-width property
## 4. Media queries
- To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths
	- (also called breakpoints)
