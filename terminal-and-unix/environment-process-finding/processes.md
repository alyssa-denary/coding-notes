## What is a process?
- A program on your computer that is being run
- Operating system ensures that the memory being used by one process cannot be accessed by another process. This means that if a program crashes, it should not affect the rest of the system. 

## Process commands
### ps
- Useful command to see which processes are running on your machine
- Most commonly exeucted as `ps aux` 
	- a: indicates that youâ€™re interested in all processes, rather than just processes for the current user
	- u: ensures the process owner will be displayed
	- x: shows all active processes, not just those attached to the terminal

- USER column: username of user who exeucuted the process
- PID: number that uniquely identifies the process. Very useful for stopping a process

### kill
- Useful for stopping a process that is unresponsive
- To stop a process, run `kill` with the PID of the process. 
```
kill 26852
```
