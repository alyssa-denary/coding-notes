### What is your terminal's environment?

A terminal's environment is a list of settings that can be referenced by programs. To see what your terminal's environment looks like right now, try typing `env` in your terminal. You should see output similar to the following:
```
rvm_bin_path=/Users/tim/.rvm/bin
